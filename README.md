# S4 - A small and fast stack machine VM

S4 is a system where the code is both human readable source code and the VM's machine code.

The entire system is inplemented one file, less than 500 lines of code, and runs on both a PC or development board via the Arduino IDE.

The reference for S4 is here: https://github.com/CCurl/S4/blob/main/ref.txt

S4 was inspired by STABLE. See https://w3group.de/stable.html for details on STABLE.
A big thanks to Sandor Schneider for the inspiration for this.
